  # This is overkill, and requires a specific version of the `http` package. I
  # just wanted to play an audio file. But I don't want to learn how to do "Dart
  # interoperability with Android" just to play the audio, and the app is only
  # used by 1 or 2 managers, I don't need to optimize and can use a bloated pkg.
